It is an XXYY cross gantry 3d printer.

The first generation got 3:21 speedboatrace score, and the 4th on the ranklist.

The second generation is underway.

## main change
1. xy: nema17 48mm stepper(voron 2.4 z stepper) -> nema14 55mm or 60mm stepper(voron v0 xy stepper)
2. z: stepper with planetary gear reducer -> voron 2.4 Z retarder
3. range: xy range (always larger than heated bed size) 110x110 -> 168x168
4. hotend from BIQU H2O to SE Mosquito Magnum+ or something with similar shape.
5. light weight Aluminum CNC XY design (yes this is the public version). All models is designed from sketch and CNC oriented.
6. ABS-printed project is deprecated because the CNC version is WAY better. But you will find it is easy to make our own ABS-printed project.

  * This is for preview. The f3d file will be free to download when the design is completed.

## One more thing
The whole project is overkilled for daily use, but is just good enough as my testing platform.

## Two more thing
I am not planning to build a BOM, *someone can count bolts and nuts by themself*.
